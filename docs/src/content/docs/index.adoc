XTDB is an immutable database, queryable with both link:/reference/main/sql/queries.html[SQL] and link:/intro/what-is-xtql.html[XTQL], that reduces the time and cost of building and maintaining safe systems of record.
It is free-to-use and open-source, under the https://opensource.org/license/mpl-2-0/[MPL license^].

You can quickly try inserting data and querying XTDB right now using the link:https://fiddle.xtdb.com/[XT fiddle] website.

Alternatively, to get up-and-running locally, check out the link:/intro/getting-started[getting started] page.

XTDB is distributed as a Docker image and is accessible over link:localhost:4322/intro/getting-started[HTTP] and via client drivers: link:/drivers/java/getting-started[Java], link:/drivers/kotlin/getting-started[Kotlin], link:/drivers/Clojure/getting-started[Clojure], and more link:/intro/roadmap.html[coming soon]!
