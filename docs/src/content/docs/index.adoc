XTDB is an immutable database, queryable with both SQL and XTQL, that reduces the time and cost of building and maintaining safe systems of record.
It is free-to-use and open-source, under the https://opensource.org/license/mpl-2-0/[MPL license^].

To quickly get up-and-running, check out our link:/intro/getting-started[getting started] guide.

For the time being, XTDB is accessible through our HTTP API and Java, Kotlin and Clojure drivers - drivers for JavaScript, Python and many more will be available in due course.
