title: Control the timeline

Everything demonstrated so far only scratches the surface of what XTDB can do, given that XTDB is a full SQL implementation with all the implications that has, however there is one further aspect where XTDB is very different to most databases: ubiquitous 'Valid-Time' versioning.

=== Valid-Time is for advanced time-travel

In addition to system-time versioning, SQL:2011 also defines 'application-time' versioning. XTDB applies this versioning to all tables and refers to it as valid-time.

Valid-time is a key tool for developers who need to offer time-travel functionality within their applications. It is a rigourously defined model that can help avoid cluttering schemas and queries with bespoke `updated_at`, `deleted_at` and `effective_from` columns (...and all the various TRIGGERs that typically live alongside those).

Developers who try to build useful functionality on top of system-time directly will likely encounter issues with migrations, backfill, and out-of-order ingestion. Valid-time solves these challenges head-on whilst also enabling other advanced usage scenarios:

. *corrections* - curate a timeline of versions with an ability to correct data - an essential capability for applications where recording the full context behind critical decisions is needed
. *global scheduling* - control exactly when data is visible to as-of-now queries by loading data with future valid-time timestamps, without needing to complicate your schema or queries - data will 'appear' and 'disappear' automatically as wall-clock time progresses

Note that valid-time as provided by XTDB is specifically about the validity (or "effective from" time) of a given row in the table, and not _necessarily_ (unless you carefully map it 1:1) some other domain conception of time.

=== INSERT into the past

We can specify the `xt$valid_from` column during an INSERT statement to record when the _organization_ (i.e. thinking beyond this particular database!) first became aware of `carol`:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO people (xt$id, name, favorite_color, xt$valid_from)
  VALUES (2, 'carol', 'blue', DATE '2024-01-01');
----

=== What did you know?

We can now show that we knew `carol` existed in the company records before this database was even created:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM people FOR VALID_TIME AS OF DATE '2024-02-01';
----

=== When did you know it?

The 'bitemporal' combination of valid-time and system-time columns allows us to readily prove an auditable history about what we claimed to have known in the past:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT people.xt$id, people.xt$valid_from, people.xt$system_from
  FROM people FOR ALL VALID_TIME FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME;
----

== Next steps!

You have now learned the essentials of using XTDB!
